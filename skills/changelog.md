## security — v2.1 (2026-03-31)

| Change | Affects |
|--------|---------|

| In-memory rate limiter is serverless-unsafe — use Upstash/Redis in production | `lib/security/rate-limit.ts` |
| CSP `unsafe-eval` + `unsafe-inline` flagged by OWASP 2025 — prefer nonce-based CSP | `middleware.ts` |
| `headers()` in Next.js 15+ must be `await`-ed — CSRF helper updated | `lib/security/csrf.ts` |
| `javascript:` URLs blocked automatically in Next.js 16.2.1 for `router.push`, `redirect`, `<Link>` | navigation code |

---

## nextjs-core — v2.0

| Change | Affects |
|--------|---------|
| `experimental.strictRouteTypes: true` now available — type-checks page props at build time | `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx` |
| `logging.serverFunctions: true` — server action calls logged with timing by default | Server Actions |
| `javascript:` URLs blocked automatically in `router.push`, `redirect`, `<Link>` | redirect/navigation code |
| `params` and `searchParams` are now `Promise<{...}>` — must be `await`-ed | all dynamic routes `[id]` |
| `useFormState` removed (React 19) — use `useActionState` from `react` (returns `[state, action, isPending]`) | forms wired to Server Actions |

---

## react-patterns — v2.0

| Change | Affects |
|--------|---------|
| `useFormState` removed — use `useActionState` from `react` (returns `[state, action, isPending]`) | any form wired to a Server Action |
| `use()` hook — read a Promise or Context directly in render without `useEffect` | data fetching in Client Components |
| `useOptimistic()` — optimistic UI updates while an async action is pending | forms, like/vote buttons |

---

## prisma — v1.0 (2026-03-31)

| Change | Affects |
|--------|---------|
| `prisma generate --no-engine` — lightweight client without query engine binary (for edge runtimes) | Vercel Edge, Cloudflare Workers |

| `$transaction` now supports `isolation level` option | critical write operations |

| `vi.restoreAllMocks()` no longer resets automocks — use `vi.resetAllMocks()` + `vi.restoreAllMocks()` together in `afterEach` | any test using `vi.mock()` |

---

## typescript — v2.0

| Change | Affects |
|--------|---------|
| Inferred type predicates (TS 5.5) — `arr.filter(Boolean)` now correctly narrows to non-nullable | array filtering patterns |
| `NoInfer<T>` utility type (TS 5.4) — prevents inference from a specific type parameter | generic utility functions |
| `using` / `await using` (TS 5.2) — explicit resource disposal | DB connections, file handles |

---

## ui-engineering — v3.3

| Change | Affects |
|--------|---------|
| Tailwind v4: CSS-first config — `tailwind.config.js` replaced by `@import "tailwindcss"` + CSS variables | projects upgrading from Tailwind v3 |
| Tailwind v4: `@theme` directive — define design tokens directly in CSS | custom colors, spacing, fonts |

---

## state-management — v1.0

| Change | Affects |
|--------|---------|
| `useOptimistic()` is now stable (React 19) — prefer it over manual optimistic state patterns | like, vote, toggle, reorder interactions |
| `use()` hook reads a Context or Promise synchronously — replaces `useContext` for many cases | global state reads in deeply nested components |
| Zustand 5: `create` no longer requires `immer` for nested updates — use `set` with draft directly | Zustand stores with nested objects |

---

## api-design — v2.0

| Change | Affects |
|--------|---------|
| Next.js 16.2: `javascript:` URLs blocked in `redirect()` and `router.push()` | API routes that redirect based on user input |

---

## performance — v2.0

| Change | Affects |
|--------|---------|
| Next.js 16.2: Cache Components architecture replaces PPR — static segments cached in segment cache | pages mixing static and dynamic content |
| Next.js 16.2: `experimental.prefetchInlining` — bundles segment prefetches into a single response | navigation-heavy apps |
| Next.js 16.2: `images.maximumDiskCacheSize` — LRU disk cache limit for `next/image` (was unbounded) | apps with large image sets |
