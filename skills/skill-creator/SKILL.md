# Skill Creator - Meta Skill

> **Purpose:** This meta-skill provides the template and guidelines for creating new skills that integrate seamlessly with the Universal AI Development Library.

---

## 📋 Skill Creation Checklist

Before creating a new skill, verify:

- [ ] The pattern isn't already covered by existing skills
- [ ] The scope is well-defined (not too broad, not too narrow)
- [ ] There are clear, enforceable rules (not just suggestions)
- [ ] Examples demonstrate both ❌ and ✅ patterns
- [ ] The skill integrates with existing architecture

---

## 📄 Skill Template

Use this exact template when creating new skills:

````markdown
---
name: [Skill Name]
description: |
  [2-3 sentence description of what this skill enforces]
  Trigger: [When this skill should be auto-invoked]
version: 1.0.0
scope: [global | feature | project]
auto_invoke:
  patterns:
    - "[file patterns that trigger this skill]"
  actions:
    - "[user actions that trigger this skill]"
---

# [Skill Name]

> **Core Principle:** [One sentence philosophy that guides all rules in this skill]

---

## 🆕 What's New

> **Instruction for Claude:** When this skill is loaded for a task, check this table and mention any entry relevant to what the developer is working on. This table is also the source for `skills/changelog.md` — every skill version bump MUST add a row here.

| Version | Change | Affects |
|---------|--------|---------|
| x.x | [brief description of what changed] | [file type / feature area] |

_Start with an empty table. Add a row for every version update — breaking changes, new patterns, removed patterns. This is the skill's changelog._

## 🎯 Skill Categories

When creating a skill, determine its category:

| Category | Location | Scope | Example |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Generic** | `/skills/generic/` | Applies to all projects | TypeScript, UI |
| **Framework** | `/skills/frameworks/` | Specific framework patterns | Next.js, React Native |
| **Domain** | `/skills/domains/` | Business domain rules | E-commerce, SaaS |
| **Project** | `/skills/projects/` | Single project rules | Client-specific |

---

## 📝 Writing Guidelines

### Agents Are Lean

Agents (`.claude/agents/*.md`) are **routing context only** — ~75 lines max. They define the role, core rules, file structure, and a checklist. All code examples, detailed patterns, and anti-patterns live in the SKILL.md files, not in the agent. The agent declares which skills it orchestrates via the `skills:` frontmatter field for automatic lazy loading.

### Rule Clarity

Each rule must be:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Specific** | Clear criteria for pass/fail |
| **Actionable** | Developer knows exactly what to do |
| **Justified** | Includes "why" not just "what" |
| **Testable** | Can be verified programmatically or by review |

```markdown
// ❌ Vague rule
"Use good naming conventions"

// ✅ Specific rule
"Function names must be verbs describing the action: `getUserById`, `validateInput`, `sendEmail`"
```

### Code Examples

Every rule needs both patterns:

```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Always show the anti-pattern with explanation
const bad = example()

// ✅ CORRECT - Always show the correct implementation
const good = example()
```

### Severity Levels

Use consistent terminology:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **FORBIDDEN** | Never do this, will be rejected in code review |
| **AVOID** | Strong suggestion against, exceptions possible |
| **PREFER** | Recommended approach, alternatives exist |
| **REQUIRED** | Must do this, no exceptions |

---

## 🔗 Skill Integration

### How Skills Are Loaded

Skills are loaded **on demand (lazy)**, not all upfront. Claude consults `skills/_index.md` to know what exists, then loads a specific skill only when about to write code in that domain. Native agents (`.claude/agents/*.md`) declare their skills in the frontmatter `skills:` field — Claude Code loads these automatically when the agent is invoked.

### Updating AGENTS.md

After creating a skill, add it to the router:

```markdown
<!-- In AGENTS.md Auto-Invoke table -->
| [trigger action] | `/skills/[category]/[name]` | [priority] |

<!-- In Skills Index table -->
| [Name] | `/skills/[category]/[name]/SKILL.md` | [Description] |
```

Also add the skill to `skills/_index.md` and to the `skills:` field of any relevant agent in `.claude/agents/`.

### Cross-Skill References

If your skill depends on or extends another:

```markdown
---
extends:
  - /skills/generic/typescript
requires:
  - /skills/generic/database
---
```

---

## 🧪 Skill Validation

Before finalizing a skill:

### 1. Coverage Test

```bash
# The skill should cover common scenarios
✓ Basic usage pattern
✓ Edge cases
✓ Error handling
✓ Integration with other rules
```

### 2. Conflict Check

Ensure no conflicts with existing skills:

```markdown
# Check existing skills for overlapping rules
/skills/generic/typescript  - Type rules
/skills/generic/nextjs-core - Framework rules
/skills/generic/ui-engineering - UI rules
/skills/generic/database - Data rules
```

### 3. Real-World Test

Apply the skill to a real codebase section and verify all rules are applicable and beneficial.

## 📚 Example: Creating a Testing Skill

Here's a complete example of creating a new skill:

```markdown
---
name: Testing Patterns - Vitest
description: |
  Production testing patterns using Vitest with Testing Library.
  Trigger: Activated when creating or editing test files.
version: 1.0.0
scope: global
auto_invoke:
  patterns:
    - "**/*.test.ts"
    - "**/*.test.tsx"
    - "**/*.spec.ts"
  actions:
    - "write test"
    - "create test"
    - "add test"
---

# Testing Patterns - Vitest

> **Core Principle:** Test behavior, not implementation. Every test should survive a refactor.

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN PATTERNS

### 1. Never Test Implementation Details

```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Testing internal state
it('should set loading to true', () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useData())
  expect(result.current.isLoading).toBe(true)
})

// ✅ CORRECT - Testing user-visible behavior
it('should show loading spinner while fetching', () => {
  render(<DataComponent />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('status')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

### 2. Never Use Arbitrary Timeouts

```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Flaky tests
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
expect(element).toBeVisible()

// ✅ CORRECT - Wait for condition
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(element).toBeVisible()
})
```

---

## ✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS

### 1. Arrange-Act-Assert Structure

```typescript
it('should create a new project', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const user = userEvent.setup()
  render(<CreateProjectForm />)
  
  // Act
  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('Name'), 'My Project')
  await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Create' }))
  
  // Assert
  expect(await screen.findByText('Project created')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

## 🚀 Skill Maintenance

### Replace, Not Append

When updating a skill, **replace the old pattern with the new one** — do not accumulate both. The file should stay the same length or get shorter. Old patterns that no longer apply must be removed, not commented out or kept "for reference". Every update must also add a row to the What's New table — this feeds `skills/changelog.md`.

### Version Updates

When updating a skill:

1. Increment version in frontmatter
2. **Add a row to the What's New table** with what changed and what it affects
3. Replace outdated patterns — do not keep the old version alongside the new one
4. Update compatibility note

### Deprecation Process

```markdown
---
deprecated: true
deprecation_notice: |
  This skill is deprecated in favor of `/skills/generic/new-skill`.
  Migration guide: [link]
  Removal date: 2025-01-01
