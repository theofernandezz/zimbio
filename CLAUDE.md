# AI Development Library - Claude Code

> This file configures how Claude Code should use the skills library for development.

---

## Skills System

This library contains **skills** (code patterns) and **specialized agents** (domain-specific context) that guide how code should be written.

### Skill Loading (Lazy)

**Load skills on demand — not all upfront.**

1. Consult `skills/_index.md` to know what skills exist (lightweight, ~20 lines)
2. Load a skill ONLY when you are about to write code in that domain
3. If the task touches multiple domains, load each skill at the moment you need to write in that domain — not all at the beginning

If you don't follow the skill patterns, the code will be rejected.

---

## Automatic Skill Detection

When about to write code in these areas, **load the corresponding skill at that moment**:

| If you're...                         | Skill                      | Path                                       |

## Domain Delegation

When a task belongs to a specific domain, **load the corresponding agent** to get full context:

| Domain             | Agent               | When to use                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **UI/Frontend**    | `agents/ui.md`      | Components, styles, animations, accessibility  |
| **Backend/Server** | `agents/backend.md` | Server Actions, APIs, database, business logic |
| **Auth**           | `agents/auth.md`    | Authentication, authorization, RLS, sessions   |
| **Testing**        | `agents/testing.md` | Unit tests, integration, E2E                   |

### How to "Delegate"

Delegation in Claude Code is done by loading additional context:

```
1. Read the agent file (e.g. agents/ui.md)
2. Identify the skills it orchestrates
3. Load each skill when you are about to write code in that domain
4. Execute the task following the loaded patterns
```

## Pending Improvements

**At the start of every session in this library, read both:**
- **`skills/improvements.md`** — patterns identified in real usage not yet merged into skills
- **`skills/changelog.md`** — recent breaking changes and new APIs across all skills

Apply pending improvements when relevant. Before writing code, mention any changelog entry that applies to the developer's current task.

---

## Self-Improvement Signals

**You MUST write a SIGNAL to `skills/improvements.md` whenever you encounter any of these during a task:**

| Signal Type       | When to write it                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SIGNAL:gap`      | You loaded a skill but it was missing a pattern you needed             |
| `SIGNAL:missing`  | You needed a skill that doesn't exist in this library                  |
| `SIGNAL:stale`    | A skill referenced an outdated API, version, or deprecated pattern     |
| `SIGNAL:conflict` | Two loaded skills gave contradictory guidance for the same case        |
| `SIGNAL:unclear`  | A skill rule was ambiguous and you had to guess the intent             |

**Write signals immediately when you notice them — not at the end of the task.**

Signal format (append to `skills/improvements.md`):

```markdown
## [Date] — SIGNAL:[type] — [skill-name or "new-skill"]

**Trigger:** [one sentence: what you were doing when you hit this]
**Gap:** [what was missing, stale, or unclear]
**Suggested fix:** [what the skill should say / what new skill is needed]
**Priority:** Critical | High | Low
```

This is the primary mechanism for the library to improve from real usage. Every signal you write is a future improvement waiting to be merged.

## Meta-Skills

For special library tasks:

| Task                | Skill           | Instructions                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create new skill    | `skill-creator` | Read `skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` and follow the template |
| Sync AGENTS.md      | `skill-sync`    | Run `./skills/skill-sync/assets/sync.sh`                     |
| Record improvements | `feedback-loop` | Read `skills/feedback-loop/SKILL.md`                         |

## Global Rules (Always Apply)

These rules are **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and apply to ALL code:

### Type Safety

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Instant rejection
const data: any = await fetch(...)
function process(input: any): any

// REQUIRED - Always explicit types
const data: UserResponse = await fetchUser(id)
function process(input: ProcessInput): ProcessOutput
```

### No Enums

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN
enum UserRole {
  Admin = "ADMIN",
  User = "USER",
}

// REQUIRED - const assertion
const USER_ROLES = { Admin: "ADMIN", User: "USER" } as const;
type UserRole = (typeof USER_ROLES)[keyof typeof USER_ROLES];
```

### Server-First (Next.js)

- Server Components by default
- Client Components only for interactivity
- NEVER use useEffect for data fetching
- NEVER use API routes for internal operations

### Security

- Validate ALL input with Zod
- RLS on ALL Supabase tables
- NEVER trust client-side checks
- NEVER expose internal errors to the user

### Imports

```typescript
// 1. React/Next.js core
import { Suspense } from "react";
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";

// 2. External libraries
import { z } from "zod";

// 3. Internal aliases (alphabetical)
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
```

### Naming Conventions

| Entity             | Convention             | Example                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Files (components) | `kebab-case.tsx`       | `user-profile-card.tsx` |
| Files (utilities)  | `kebab-case.ts`        | `format-date.ts`        |
| React Components   | `PascalCase`           | `UserProfileCard`       |
| Functions          | `camelCase`            | `formatUserDate`        |
| Constants          | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`    |
| Types/Interfaces   | `PascalCase`           | `UserProfile`           |
| Zod Schemas        | `camelCase` + `Schema` | `userProfileSchema`     |

## Workflow

```
User requests something
    ↓
1. Analyze the task — identify domains and technologies involved
    ↓
2. Consult _index.md if unsure which skill applies
    ↓
3. When about to write code in domain X → load skill X at that moment
    ↓
4. Write code following the loaded skill's patterns
    ↓
5. Move to next domain → load its skill when you get there
    ↓
6. Verify against each loaded skill's checklist
```
